# here we can excersize our coding skills in any language

we start with nodejs and add languages as we go.
hopefully we will air some projects that will meen something eventualy

 we should install node from https://nodejs.org/en/

 and download the version we want (always take the latest stable version)
 To make sure we have node and npm installed we type in terminal node -v and npm -v and should see the versions of both

 After that we should open the terminal and go to the project folder, type npm init in order to create the package.json file, 
 This file includes all project's settings and dependencies
 Every node project should have a folder name node_modules that includes every dependency we install from the npm library, this folder is created when we use  the command npm i (or npm install)

# This is ho the package.json file looks like ☝️

# This is the basic node project structure ☝️
 We can go to https://www.npmjs.com/ to find packages and get information about every package
